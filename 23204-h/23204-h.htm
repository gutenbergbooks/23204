<h3>A WORD TO THE LITERARY MEN OF ENGLAND.</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Twenty scholars in seven years might retrieve the worst losses we
  experience from the bigotry of popes and califs.</i> I do not intend to
  assert that every Herculanean manuscript might, within that period, be
  unfolded; but the three first legible sentences might be; which is quite
  sufficient to inform the intelligent reader whether a farther attempt on
  the scroll would repay his trouble. <i>There are fewer than thirty Greek
  authors worth inquiring for; they exist, beyond doubt, and beyond doubt
  they may, by attention, patience, and skill, be brought to light.</i> * *
  With a <i>smaller</i> sum than is annually expended on the appointment of
  some silly and impertinent young envoy, we might restore <i>all</i>, or
  <i>nearly all</i> those writers of immortal name, whose disappearance has
  been the regret of genius for four entire centuries. In my opinion, a
  <i>few thousand pounds</i>, laid out on such an undertaking, would be
  laid out as creditably as on a Persian carpet or a Turkish
  tent."&mdash;Landor's <i>Imaginary Conversations&mdash;Southey and
  Porson&mdash;Works</i>, vol. i. p. 20.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I call upon the literary men of England, upon the English government,
  and upon the public, to set the example in a glorious expedition, which,
  even in this age of wonders, is one of no little importance and
  magnitude. I conjure them to bear in mind the words I have placed at the
  head of this article,&mdash;the opinion of one of our best and most
  delightful authors. This opinion Mr. Landor, veiled under the eidolon of
  Porson, I feel assured, does not hold alone; I believe it to be engraven
  on the "red-leaved tablets" of the hearts of many more learned and more
  distinguished scholars than myself, who am but as the trumpet which is to
  rouse the friends of classical literature to action; as the bell which
  awakens the reaper to his abundant harvest: but I will sustain, that on
  none of them is it cut more deeply or more inextinguishably than on
  mine.</p>

  <p>I propose that the friends of Classical, Scandinavian, and Oriental
  literature form themselves into an Association for the Rescue of the many
  ancient MSS. in the Greek, Latin, Anglo-Saxon, Norwegian, Zend, Sanscrit,
  Hebrew, Abyssinian, Ethiopian, Hindostanee, Persian, Syriac, Arabic,
  Armenian, Coptic, Turkish, and Chinese languages:&mdash;that application
  be made to government for the pecuniary furtherance of this
  enterprise;&mdash;and that the active co-operation of all foreign
  literary men be secured.<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus a careful and untiring search may be entered upon in all the
  regions of the earth where any MSS. are likely to be found, and the
  recovery or loss of the many inestimable authors of antiquity be made
  certain. Let the libraries of Europe be examined strictly and
  inquisitorially (and this will not be a heavy expense), and the new
  accessions to classical literature printed, the MSS. <!-- Page 162
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>{162}</span>which present
  themselves of already known authors carefully examined, and the
  variations to the received text marked. How much this is wanted we
  experience in the corruptions of Sophocles, Æschylus, Thucydides, Plato,
  and Aristoteles! In this way much that is valuable may be recovered; much
  that is matter of discussion set at rest. Let me instance the Babrian
  fables, and the discovery of Mr. Harris at Alexandria; who, it was
  remarked to me, might have discovered the whole, instead of a part, had
  proper hands unfolded the mummy.</p>

  <p>On the advantages of this search, it were useless to expatiate: every
  one is sensible of it, and, sooner or later, it <i>must</i> occur. Let us
  not allow our grandchildren to surpass us in everything, but let us set
  about this ourselves. Monstrous as the idea seems, it is simple of
  execution.</p>

  <p>I will not take up the space so kindly afforded me by the Editor of
  "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" with speculation. The
  Association should be composed of a Literary Section and a Business
  Section: the first to be under the administration of a President and an
  efficient Board of Examiners, to look into literary matters, and examine
  and appoint the proper officers of the Investigation Parties; which
  parties must be composed of clever, adventurous, hardy, and adroit men,
  obtaining the assistance of the natives wherever they may be carrying on
  their researches; the Second Section to be under the direction of a
  Chairman and Finance Committee, to which the officers of the subordinate
  departments render their accounts.</p>

  <p>I know not whether more will be required of me on this subject; very
  likely not: but I reserve much that I could say, until that time. I have
  now only to thank the Editor for inserting this long, but I will not say,
  wholly uninteresting proposal.</p>

<h3>THE ESSAY ON SATIRE.</h3>

  <p>Dryden, as sir Walter Scott observes, left a name in literature
  "second only to those of Milton and Shakspere"; but, popular as his
  writings were, he gave no collective edition of his poetical or dramatic
  works. The current editions of his poems may therefore be open to
  censure, both on the score of deficiency and redundancy&mdash;and such I
  believe to be the fact.</p>

  <p>An <i>Essay on satire</i>, itself a coarse satire, has been ascribed
  to him for more than a century on dubious authority, and the correctness
  of this ascription has been properly suggested as a question for
  examination.</p>

  <p>We have to decide on the credibility of two opposite statements, as
  made in the publications about to be enumerated:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. "The works of John Sheffield, earl of Mulgrave, marquis of
  Normanby, and duke of Buckingham. <span class="sc">London</span>: printed
  for John Barber, 1723. 4º. 2 vols."</p>

  <p>2. "The works of John Sheffield, earl of Mulgrave, marquis of
  Normanby, and duke of Buckingham. Printed for John Barber, alderman of
  <span class="sc">London</span>, 1726. Small 8º. 2 vols."</p>

  <p>3. "Original poems and translations, by John Dryden, Esq. <span
  class="sc">London</span>: printed for J. and R. Tonson, 1743. 12º. 2
  vols."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the two former publications, the poem appears as the entire
  composition of the noble author, and is said to have been "written in the
  year 1675." In the latter publication it appears without date, and is
  said to be "by Mr. Dryden and the earl of Mulgrave."</p>

  <p>The publications were posthumous, and as the editors afford no
  explanation of the point in dispute, we must consult the reputed
  authors.</p>

  <p>In the year 1691, as an advertisement to <i>King Arthur</i>, a
  dramatic opera, Dryden printed a catalogue of his "plays and poems in
  quarto," in order to prevent future mis-ascriptions. The catalogue
  comprises ten poems, but no <i>Essay on satire</i>. The publisher of
  <i>King Arthur</i> was Mr. Jacob Tonson.</p>

  <p>In 1682, the earl of Mulgrave published, anonymously, through the
  agency of Mr. Joseph Hindmarsh, an <i>Essay upon poetry</i>. It contains
  these lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The laureat here may justly claim our praise,</p>
      <p>Crown'd by <i>Mac-Fleckno</i> with immortal bays;</p>
      <p>Though prais'd and punish'd for another's rimes,</p>
      <p>His own deserve that glorious fate sometimes,</p>
      <p>Were he not forc'd to carry now dead weight,</p>
      <p>Rid by some lumpish minister of state."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In 1717, Mr. Tonson published <i>Poems by the earl of Roscommon</i>;
  and added thereto the <i>Essay on poetry</i>, "with the leave and with
  the corrections of the author." The lines shall now be given in their
  amended state, as they appear in that volume, with the accompanying
  notes:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The <i>Laureat</i><a name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> here may justly claim our praise,</p>
      <p>Crown'd by <i>Mack-Fleckno</i><a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> with immortal bays;</p>
      <p>Tho' <i>prais'd</i> and <i>punish'd</i> once for other's<a name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> rhimes,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Next to Dryden and the earl of Mulgrave, as authorities on this
  question, comes the elder Jacob Tonson. Both writers were contributors to
  his <i>Poetical miscellanies</i>. In 1701 he published <i>Poems on
  various occasions, etc. By Mr. John Dryden</i>. The volume has not the
  <i>Essay on satire</i>. The same <!-- Page 163 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>{163}</span>Tonson, as we have just
  seen, gave currency to the assertion that Dryden was "ignorant of the
  whole matter."</p>

  <p>To this display of contemporary evidence must be added the information
  derivable from the posthumous publications enumerated in the former part
  of this article. The publication of 1723 was made by direction of the
  duchess of Buckingham. The couplet, "Tho' prais'd," &amp;c., and the
  appended note, were omitted. In 1726 Mr. alderman Barber republished the
  volumes "with several additions, and without any castrations," restoring
  the couplet and note as they were printed in 1717. In the <i>Original
  poems</i> of Dryden, as collectively published in 1743, the joint
  authorship is stated without a word of evidence in support of it.</p>

  <p>If we turn to the earlier writers on Dryden, we meet with no facts in
  favour of his claim to the poem in question. Anthony à Wood says, "the
  earl of Mulgrave was generally thought to be the author." This was
  written about 1694. The reverend Thomas Birch, a man of vast information,
  repeated this statement in 1736. Neither Congreve nor Giles Jacob allude
  to the poem.</p>

  <p>The witnesses on the other side are, 1. The publisher of the <i>State
  poems</i>. 2. Dean Lockier. And 3. The reverend Thomas Broughton.</p>

  <p>The <i>State poems</i>, in which the essay is ascribed to Dryden, may
  be called a surreptitious publication: it carries no authority. The
  testimony of Lockier, which is to the same effect, was never published by
  himself. It was a scrap of conversation held thirty years after the death
  of Dryden, and reported by another from memory. The reverend Thomas
  Broughton, who asserts the joint authorship of the poems, cites as his
  authority the <i>Original poems</i>, &amp;c. Now Kippis assures us that
  he edited those volumes. On the question at issue, he could discover no
  authority but himself!</p>

  <p>Dryden <i>may</i> have revised the <i>Essay on satire</i>. Is that a
  sufficient reason for incorporating it with his works? Do we tack to the
  works of Pope the poems of Wycherly and Parnell? We have authority for
  stating that Pope revised the <i>Essay on poetry</i>. Is it to be added
  to the works of Pope? Be it as it may, the poem was published, in
  substance, six years before Pope was born!</p>

  <p>As the evidence is very brief, there can be no necessity for
  recapitulation; and I shall only add, that if about to edit the poetical
  works of Dryden, I should reject the <i>Essay on satire</i>.</p>

<h3>MACKLIN'S ORDINARY AND SCHOOL OF CRITICISM.</h3>

  <p>Mr. George Wingrove Cooke, in his valuable work, <i>The History of
  Party</i> (vol. iii, p. 66.), gives an admirable sketch of the life of
  Edmund Burke. Speaking of his early career, and of the various designs
  which he formed for his future course, we are told that "at <i>Macklin's
  Debating Society</i> he made the first essay of his powers of
  oratory."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cunningham, in his <i>Handbook for London</i>, speaks of Macklin
  delivering Lectures on Elocution at Pewterer's Hall (p. 394.), and of his
  residence in Tavistock Row, Covent Garden (p. 484.); but he does not
  mention <i>Macklin's Debating Society</i>. I imagine that by this
  "Debating Society" is meant an <i>Ordinary and School of Criticism</i>,
  which that eminent actor established in the year 1754, in the Piazza,
  Covent Garden. Mr. W. Cooke, in his <i>Life of Macklin</i>, 1806, p.
  199., says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"What induced him [Macklin] to quit the stage in the full vigour of
  fame and constitution, was one of those schemes which he had long
  previously indulged himself in, of suddenly making his fortune by the
  establishment of a tavern and coffee-house in the Piazza, Covent Garden;
  to which he afterwards added a school of oratory, upon a plan hitherto
  unknown in England, founded upon the Greek, Roman, French, and Italian
  Societies, under the title of <i>The British Inquisition</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The first part of this plan (the public ordinary) was opened on the
  11th of March, 1754; and an amusing account of its operations may be
  found in Angelo's <i>Pic Nic</i>, p. 32. The second part of "Macklin's
  mad plan," as it was then termed, "The British Inquisition," commenced
  proceedings on the 21st of November in the same year; and here, according
  to the first advertisement, "such subjects in Arts, Sciences, Literature,
  Criticism, Philosophy, History, Politics, and Morality, as shall be found
  useful and entertaining to society, will be lectured upon and freely
  debated."</p>

<h3>"LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (Act II. Scene 1.).</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is odd that Shakspeare should make Dumain inquire after Rosaline,
  who was the mistress of Biron, and neglect Katharine, who was his own.
  Biron behaves in the same manner.&mdash;Perhaps <i>all</i> the ladies
  wore masks.&mdash;<span class="sc">Steevens</span>.</p>

  <p>"They certainly did."&mdash;<span class="sc">Malone</span>.</p>

  <p>"And what if they did?"&mdash;<span class="sc">Query</span>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In what possible way can the circumstance of the ladies <i>wearing
  masks</i> lessen the inconsistency pointed out by Steevens?</p>

  <p>Rosaline has been immediately singled out by her former
  admirer&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Did I not dance with you in Brabant once?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>&mdash;a circumstance quite inconsistent with uncertain identity
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>But if the gentlemen really did mistake the identity of their ladies,
  Boyet's answers must have misled them into a similar mistake in <i>their
  names</i>: so that the natural consequence would have been, that each
  lover would afterwards address his <!-- Page 164 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>{164}</span>poetical effusion
  <i>nominally</i> to the wrong lady! which does not appear to have been
  the case.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even if the masking be admitted, it can in no way lessen
  the inconsistency of the cross questions, which to me appears to have
  arisen from a most palpable instance of clerical or typographical
  transposition.</p>

  <p>Steevens was on the right scent, although he rejected it in the same
  breath, when he said,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"No advantage would be gained by <i>an exchange of names</i>, because
  the last speech is determined to Biron by Maria, who gives a character of
  him after he has made his exit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is a good reason against a transposition in the <i>male</i>
  names, but it is none whatever against the same occurrence in the ladies'
  names; and consequently it is there that the true solution of the
  difficulty must be sought.</p>

  <p>If we admit that a substitution may have occurred, of "Rosaline" for
  "Katharine," in Boyet's answer to Dumain, and <i>vice versâ</i> in his
  answer to Biron, all difficulty disappears at once.</p>

  <p>The completeness with which the idea of transposition not only
  accounts for the existence of the error, but at the same time suggests
  the manner in which it may be corrected, ought of itself to secure its
  reception, even if it were not corroborated in a very singular way by the
  following collateral circumstance.</p>

  <p>It may be observed that Boyet points out two of the ladies, not only
  by name, but also by styling them "heirs;" one of Falconbridge, the other
  of Alençon. Now in their previous descriptions of their respective
  lovers, one of the ladies (Maria) says she had met Longaville at a
  marriage of a "Falconbridge;" another lady (Katharine) says she had met
  Dumain at "Duke Alençon's." When, therefore, we find that Boyet, in reply
  to Longaville's question, designates <i>Maria</i> as "heir of
  Falconbridge," it is in direct analogy that he should, in answer to
  Dumain's question, designate <i>Katharine</i> as "heir of Alençon;" but,
  in consequence of the transposition of names, Boyet appears, as the text
  now stands, to confer that designation, not upon Katharine, but upon
  Rosaline, whom Biron had met at Brabant!</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt, therefore, that the names of Katharine and
  Rosaline have been transposed <i>contrary to the author's intention</i>,
  and the only wonder is&mdash;not that such a very commonplace error
  should have been committed&mdash;but that it should have been suffered to
  remain through so many editions up to the present time.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON NEWSPAPERS.</h3>

  <p>I send you the following, as a help to "Materials for a satisfactory
  History of Newspapers," alluded to in the last volume of "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," p. 375.</p>

  <p>I have in my possession some old newspapers, ranging from 1691 to
  1694, entitled <i>A Collection for Improvement of Husbandry and
  Trade</i>, edited by John Houghton, F.R.S., St. Bartholomew Lane, behind
  the Royal Exchange, London. The size is a small folio, published weekly,
  generally every Friday. It was carried on for some time merely as a
  single leaf, with no advertisements. In this form, the editor
  says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"These papers are 2<i>d.</i> each here, and anybody may have them by
  the post. But where that is thought too much, it may be eased by ten or
  twelve obliging themselves constantly to take them from a bookseller,
  coffee-man, or some other, who may afford to pay a carrier, and sell them
  there for 2<i>d.</i>, or at most 3<i>d.</i>; or carriers themselves may
  gain well, if they'll serve the country gentlemen. And any such
  bookseller, coffee-man, or carrier, that will apply themselves to me,
  shall have good encouragement, with liberty to return those that won't
  sell."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Ultimately the editor determined on admitting advertisements. He then
  doubled the size of his paper, making it two leaves instead of one. In
  reference to this increased size he says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"My collection I shall carry on as usual. This part is to give away;
  and those who like it not, may omit the reading. I believe it will help
  on trade, particularly encourage the advertisers to increase the vent of
  my papers. I shall receive all sorts of advertisements, but shall answer
  for the reasonableness of none; unless I give thereof a particular
  character, on which (as I shall give it) may be dependence, but no
  argument that others deserve not as well."</p>

  <p>"I am inform'd that great numbers of gazettes are each time printed,
  which makes them the most universal intelligencers; but I'll suppose mine
  their first handmaid, because it goes (tho' not so thick, yet) to most
  parts. It's also lasting, to be put into volumes with indexes; and
  particularly there shall be an index of all the advertisements, whereby,
  for ages to come, they may be useful. I have publish'd on the subject of
  Husbandry and Trade, two quarto volumes, three folio volumes, with the
  great sheet of taxes, acres, houses, &amp;c.; and am weekly carrying on
  this paper, which may be brought to anybodies house within the Bills of
  Mortality, or penny post, for one penny the week; and anywhere else in
  England (where enough will encourage a bookseller or carrier). The
  volumes may be had from most booksellers of England, Scotland, or
  Ireland."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Collection, which the editor will carry on as usual, refers to the
  single sheet. The Gazette must have been the London Gazette. In what sort
  of way the editor could suppose that advertisements could be useful for
  ages to come, we, in this age of enlightenment and knowledge, are at a
  loss to conceive. The great sheet of taxes, acres, houses, &amp;c., I
  have, and may give you an account of its contents at some future time.
  The first page <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page165"></a>{165}</span>of the paper was always devoted to a
  letter from the editor's own pen on husbandry, trade, chemistry, domestic
  cookery, and a variety of other topics. The editor appears to have been a
  spirited man, who collected with great care and diligence a great variety
  of facts whereby to interest his readers. The advertisements are very
  curious, specimens of which I will give you in another communication.
  Each paper contains the weekly prices of wheat, rye, barley, malt, oats,
  horse beans, peas, coals, hops, hay, tallow, and wool, in all the
  counties of England and Wales; the prices of provisions in London; also a
  weekly statement of wind and weather; the number of deaths, and their
  causes; the number of christenings and burials, specifying how many of
  each sex. The editor often concludes a column of information by stating,
  "this is all I see useful to posterity." He not only appears to have been
  a man of an active mind, but also a very kind man; for he says to those
  who advertise in his paper for situations, &amp;c., that "if they apply
  themselves to me, I'll strive to help them." He appears also to have kept
  a shop, or at least to have traded in certain articles: for in one of his
  papers is this advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In my first volume of 1682, I publish'd my own selling of chocolate,
  and have sold in small quantities ever since: I have now two sorts, both
  made of the best nuts, without spice or perfume; the one 5s., and the
  other 6s. the pound; and I'll answer for their goodness. If I shall think
  fit to sell any other sorts, I'll give notice.</p>

  <p>M. Brunet informs us that copies of these volumes are valued by the

  was mended with nails, which marked the impression, and gave the
  distinction of copies before or with the nails.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Origin of Harlequins.</i>&mdash;In a note to his translation of
  Priscus' "History of the Embassy sent to Attila by Theodosius the
  Younger" (<i>Hist. Civiliz.</i> app. iii. vol. ii. p. 430., Bogue's edit.
  European Library), M. Guizot remarks, alluding to the appearance of
  Zercho, a Moor, at Attila's feast:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Is it not singular to find an harlequin at the court of Attila? Yet
  such is the origin of these buffoons. The colour of the black slaves, the
  strangeness of their face and manners, caused them to be sought after as
  excellent ministers of mirth; to complete the singularity, Zercho asks
  his wife at the hands of Attila, closely paralleling Harlequin demanding
  Columbine."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Is this account of the origin of Harlequins generally acquiesced in? I
  should be obliged by any early notice of the character of Harlequin, and
  his introduction on the English or any foreign stage.</p>

  <p class="author">E. L. N.

  <p><i>Monosyllables</i>.&mdash;Among the many correspondents who have
  sent you specimens of monosyllabic poetry, I have seen no one who has
  quoted this very singular passage from Phineas Fletcher's <i>Purple
  Island</i>. It is <i>far more striking</i> than anything you have yet

  <p><i>The Breeches, or Geneva Bible</i> (Vol. iii, p. 17.).&mdash;I have
  before me a copy of Christopher Barkar's edition of the "Breeches" Bible,
  1576, small folio, in which, on the fly-leaf, is the following
  interesting note in the handwriting of the late Francis Douce:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is generally conceived that the peculiarity, 'and they sewed fig
  tree leaves together, and made themselves breeches,' belongs exclusively
  to this Bible, but it is a mistake. The Saxon version of Ælfric has, <!--
  Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page166"></a>{166}</span>'<i>and sewed fig-leaves, and worked
  them</i> <span class="scac">WEED-BREECH</span>, <i>or cloaths for the
  breech.</i>' Wicliffe also translates 'and maden hem <i>breechis</i>;'
  and it is singular that Littleton, in his excellent <i>Dictionary</i>,
  explains <i>perizomata</i>, the word used in the Vulgate, by
  <i>breeches</i>. In the manuscript French translation of Petrus
  Comestor's <i>Commentary on the Bible</i>, made by Guiars des Moulins in
  the 13th century, we have 'Couvertures tout autres-sint comme unnes
  petites <i>braies</i>.'"</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Edward F. Rimbault.</span>

  <p><i>Etymology of Mushroom.</i>&mdash;In the sixteenth century this word
  appears generally to have been spelt <i>Mushrump</i>. Nares, in his
  valuable <i>Glossary</i>, gives an instance from Marlow's play of
  <i>Edward the Second</i>, 1598; but there is an earlier example in Robert
  Southwell's <i>Spirituall Poems</i>, 1595:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"He that high growth on cedars did bestow,</p>
      <p>Gave also lowly <i>mushrumps</i> leave to growe."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is also spelt <i>Mushrump</i> in Cockeram's <i>Dictionary</i>,
  1632. These instances may possibly lead to a correct etymology of the
  word.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Edward F. Rimbault.</span>

  <p><i>Curious Fact in Natural History.</i>&mdash;There is in the Brazils
  a popular superstition to this effect. There is a tree called Japécarga,
  which is said to grow out of the body of the insect called Cigara. This
  is a very large tree, and the Cigara is an insect which makes an
  incessant chirping on the tree, and, as the saying goes, chirps till it
  bursts. When the insect dies, the tree is said to grow out of it, the
  roots growing down the legs. My explanation is this: The insect feeds on
  the seeds of the Japécarga, and occasionally, under advantageous
  circumstances, some of the seeds germinate, and cause the death of the
  insect, the tree shooting up through the softest part, the back, and the
  rootlets making their way down the only outlets, the legs. I wish to know
  whether any similar fact in Natural History has been noticed, and if not,
  how is it accounted for, since I can vouch for the skin of the insect
  having been found with the tree growing out of its back, and the roots
  growing down through the legs.</p>

  of Switzerland have been long protected from hail by means of upright
  poles having copper wire attached to them, termed "paragrêles," distant
  from each other from 60 to 100 feet. The formation of hail is an effect
  of which electricity is the cause, and the cloud being deprived of this
  agent by the conductors, descends in the shape of rain. Mr. John Murray,
  F.S.A., F.L.S., &amp;c., in his work on Switzerland, speaks very
  decidedly of their utility. Has then this ingenious contrivance been
  considered with reference to the protection of the Great Exhibition and
  its valuable, or rather invaluable, contents? or why is it deemed
  inapplicable to the purpose?</p>

<h3>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.</h3>

  <p>Everybody can see that the first commandment is directed against
  polytheism, and the second against idolatry; and most people know that
  the Church of Rome differs from the Church of England in joining these
  two into one commandment, and dividing the tenth into two commandments,
  so as to make up the full number, ten. This point of difference betwixt
  the two churches must necessarily have been the subject of much dispute.
  There must be plausible reasons on both sides for every commandment in
  the Anglican ritual being different from its correspondent on the Roman
  tables: and the settlement of this question must properly belong to the
  theologian, since holy scripture only mentions how many divine
  commandments there are (Exodus, xxxiv. 28.; Deuteronomy, iv. 13., x. 4.),
  without authoritatively separating them.</p>

  <p>Will any one kindly inform me where this question may be found fully
  discussed; and where mention is made of the earliest known divisions of
  the law? Also, I should be glad to know how the Jews at the present day
  divide the commandments; and whether there is any record or tradition of
  there ever having been discussions in their church upon this very

  <p><i>Was Hugh Peters ever on the Stage?</i>&mdash;In a pamphlet entitled
  <i>Arbitrary Government displayed to the Life, in the illegal
  Transactions of the late Times under the tyrannick Usurpation of Oliver
  Cromwell</i>, ed. 1690, p. 98., we are informed that Hugh Peters, after

  <p><i>T. Gilburt on Clandestine Marriages.</i>&mdash;I have a MS. against

  this subject. It is entitled:</p>

  <p><i>Roman Catholic Bishops in Ireland.</i>&mdash;Can any of your

  <p><i>Derivation of the Word Fib.</i>&mdash;Can any of your readers
  suggest a proper derivation of this word? Old Bailey, to whom a reference
  would occasionally save many doubts and inquiries, connects it with
  "fable." Johnson says nothing as to the etymology, but explains it as "a
  cant word among children;" while, at the same time, he inserts it on the
  authority of Pope and Arbuthnot.</p>

  <p>In reading the works of that very learned and instructive author,
  Samuel Werenfels, I was struck with a passage in his <i>Diatribe de
  Meteoris</i>, p. 272. (Amstel. Wetstein, 1702), which seemed to furnish a
  probable solution of the question:&mdash;"Propter abusum nominis
  Ph&oelig;bi evenit, ut omnes qui, altius in oratione, quam decet, se
  extollere volunt, Gallis hodiernis <span title="phoibologein" class="grk"
  >&phi;&omicron;&iota;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&nu;</span>
  Ph&oelig;bum loqui, <i>Parler</i> <i>Phebus</i>, dicantur." So far as the
  sound is concerned, this seems a nearer approximation to "fib" than the
  word "fable." The sense, too, is not <i>very</i> remote from the accepted
  one of "<i>talking fibs</i>." Query, as to this conjecture?</p>

  <p><i>Thomas May, the Author of the Supplement to Lucan.</i>&mdash;Who
  was this Thomas May? To an Elzevir edition of Lucan, 1658, Amsterdam,
  "accuranto Cornelio Schrevelio," there is added "Supplementum Lucani
  Libri Septem; authore Thoma Maio, Anglo." In the preface it is stated,
  "Supplementum Lucani ab Anglo quodam antehâc seorsim editum, et huic
  materiæ aptissimum adjunximus, ne quid esset quod hic desideraretur." In
  the fourth book of this <i>Supplement</i>, Cato is represented as
  soliloquising before his death as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Quam diversa, inquit, restant post funera sortes!</p>
      <p>Credo equidem, divine Plato, te dogmata vera</p>

      <p>(Aut Natura homines ratioque innata fefellit)</p>
      <p>Proposuit virtutem, et præmia debita justis</p>
      <p>Hæc quonian justos injusta potentia fraudat</p>

      <p>Solvere post mortem justissimus ipse tenetur."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The famous soliloquy in Addison's <i>Cato</i> seems to resemble this,
  in its general tone of thought. In a former passage occur these
  lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="i6hg3">"Solatia sola hæc,</p>

  <p>Addison seems to me to have had May's description of Cato's death in
  his mind, when he wrote the soliloquy.</p>

  idea, which we so strenuously maintain, that "<i>Ich Dien</i>" is a
  misspelled edition of "<i>Eich Dyn</i>," "Behold the man:" and that the
  motto was bestowed on Edward of Carnarvon in consequence of his royal

<h3>CARDINAL'S MONUMENT.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 106.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent and querist, J. D. A., asks for some information
  respecting the coat of arms surmounted by a cardinal's hat, sculptured
  and affixed to one of the pillars of the south transept in St. Saviour's
  Church, Southwark. I send in reply an extract from a now scarce book,
  Arthur Tiler's <i>History and Antiquities of St. Saviour's</i>, 1765,
  with which all the later historians of the church agree:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">"Anno 1400. &nbsp; 2 Hen. IV.</p>

  <p>"The whole church was new built about this time; Henry Beaufort
  (second son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, son of Edward III.),
  Cardinal of St. Eusebius, and Bishop of Winchester from the year 1405 to
  the time of his death in 1447, might have contributed towards the
  building, being a man of great wealth, for which he was called the rich
  Cardinal, <i>as the arms of the Beauforts are carved in stone on a pillar
  in the south cross aisle; and by the remaining sculpture on each side it
  appears to be done for strings pendant from a Cardinal's hat placed over
  them</i>. The arms are quarterly France and England, a border compone
  argent and azure."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>When the transepts were rebuilt, some years since, the cardinal's hat,
  which till that time was nearly defaced, was then restored, and the coat
  of arms newly emblazoned.</p>

  <p>With reference to the Query of J. D. A. (p. 106. antè), it would
  appear that the cardinal's hat, but with a difference in the number of
  rows of tassels, is sometimes seen on the monuments of men who never were
  raised to that dignity.</p>

  <p>In the Cathedral of St. Canice, Kilkenny, are two monuments placed
  there during the rule of the Confederate Catholics, viz., that of James
  Cleere, "Protonotarius et Rector ecclesiæ D. Joannis Di&oelig;cesis
  oporiensis," who died <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1643, Nov. 14; and
  David Rothe, intrusive Roman Catholic Bishop of Ossery, who died some
  years after&mdash;on both of which the arms of the individual are
  surmounted by a cardinal's hat. It is quite certain that neither of these
  ecclesiastics had a right to this distinction <i>as cardinals</i>. For
  the right of Bishops and Prothonotaries to wear hats or caps of the same
  shape as the cardinals, with their colours and peculiarities, see
  <i>Glossary of Heraldry</i> (Oxford), under "Cap-Cardinals." Any further
  examples will oblige</p>

  <p>The Cardinal's hat, with arms beneath, on a pillar near the poet
  Gower's monument, in St. Saviour's, Southwark, refers directly to the
  beneficence of that busy cardinal and very remarkable man, <!-- Page 170
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>{170}</span>Cardinal
  Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, and who in that capacity resided in the
  adjoining palace; indirectly it refers to the marriage of James V. of
  Scotland with Jane Beaufort, the Cardinal's niece: and it is something to
  the honour of St. Mary Overies, (the church in question,) to add that it
  was within its walls that the ceremony took place. Besides Gower, the
  parish registers state that Edmond Shakspeare ob. 1607 (one of the
  brothers of the great dramatist), John Fletcher ob. 1625, and Philip
  Massinger ob. 1640. (See Mr. Knight's <i>Old England</i>, eng. 548. p.
  147.)</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Blowen</span>.

  <p>A cardinal's hat is differenced by colour and the number of its
  tassels, not by its shape, which is the same for all clergymen. Thus, for
  simple priests, a black hat, with one tassel on either side; for a
  bishop, a green hat with three tassels; for a cardinal, a crimson hat
  with five or seven tassels. What the reason may be for the variation in
  the number of the tassels amongst cardinals, I should be glad to
  learn.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">W. D-n</span>.

  <p>In Ciaconius (<i>Vitæ et Res Gestæ Pontificum</i>, Rome, 1630), there
  is a list of all the cardinals created up to that date, with their
  armorial bearings; and the only instances of France and England quarterly
  (which is, no doubt, what is intended), are those of Cardinal Beaufort,
  Bishop of Winchester, and Cardinal Hallum, Bishop of Salisbury. I can
  find no mention anywhere of the family of Cardinal Hallum, or Hallam; and
  should be glad to know who he was descended from, and why he had those
  arms assigned to him by Ciaconius, who is tolerably correct.</p>

<h3>BOOTY'S CASE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 40.)</p>

  <p>I cannot refer <span class="sc">Demonologist</span> to an
  <i>authentic</i> report of Booty's case, but I believe none is more so,

  247.</p>

  <p>The following extract is given from the journal of Mr.
  Spinks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Friday, 15th May, 1687. We had the observation of Mr. Booty this day.
  Captain Barrisby, Captain Bristowe, Captain Brown, I, and Mr. Ball,
  merchant, went on shore in Captain Barnaby's boat, to shoot rabbits upon
  Stromboli; and when we had done we called all our men together by us, and
  about half an hour and fourteen minutes after three in the afternoon, to
  our great surprise, we all of us saw two men come running towards us with
  such swiftness that no living man could run half so fast as they did run,
  when all of us heard Captain Barnaby say, 'Lord bless me, the foremost is
  old Booty, my next-door neighbour;' but he said he did not know the other
  that run behind: he was in black clothes, and the foremost was in grey.
  Then Captain Barnaby desired all of us to take an account of the time,
  and put it down in our pocket-books, and when we got on board we wrote it
  in our journals; for we saw them into the flames of fire, and there was a
  great noise which greatly affrighted us all; for we none of us ever saw
  or heard the like before. Captain Barnaby said he was certain it was old
  Booty, which he saw running over Stromboli and into the flames of Hell.
  It is stated that Captain Barnaby told his wife, and she told somebody
  else, and that it was afterward told to Mrs. Booty, who arrested Captain
  Barnaby in a thousand pound action, for what he had said of her husband.
  Captain Barnaby gave bail to it, and it came on to a trial in the Court
  of King's Bench, and they had Mr. Booty's wearing apparel brought into
  court, and the sexton of the parish, and the people that were with him
  when he died; and we swore to our journals, and it came to the same time
  within two minutes; ten of our men swore to the buttons on his coat, and
  that they were covered with the same sort of cloth his coat was made of,
  and so it proved. The jury asked Mr. Spinks if he knew Mr. Booty. He
  answered, 'I never saw him till he ran by me on the burning
  mountain.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The chief justice from April, 1687, to February, 1689, was Sir Robert
  Wright. His name is not given in the report, but <i>the judge</i>
  said&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Lord have mercy upon me, and grant that I may never see what you have
  seen: one, two, or three may be mistaken, but thirty never can be
  mistaken. So the widow lost her suit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>An action for slander of a deceased husband, brought by the widow, and
  the defendant held to bail, is a remarkable beginning. The plea of
  justification, that Booty ran into Hell, is hardly supported by evidence
  that he ran into the flames at Stromboli. The evidence was, that the
  defendant <i>said</i> that one of the two runners was Booty; it does not
  appear that the other witnesses knew him. The witnesses must have kept a
  good look to observe the buttons of Booty's coat when he ran more than
  twice as fast as any living man could run. Finally, as the time of the
  death and the observation "came to the same within two minutes," and
  Stromboli is about 15° east of Gravesend, Booty must have run to Hell
  before he died.</p>

  <p>I have no doubt that "the case is well known in the navy." The facts
  are of the sort usually reported to the marines; but the law such as was
  unknown before 9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. 95.</p>

<h3>THE CONQUEST.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 440.; Vol. iii., p. 92.)</p>

  <p>I question the position of S. K., that the phrase "post conquestum" is
  used in the deed he cites (Vol. ii., p. 92.) for the accession of the
  king. "Post conquestum" was, in records and deeds, applied with more or
  less frequency to all our kings, from Edward III. to Henry VIII. To show
  this I give the following references to the pages of Madox's <i>Formulare
  Anglicanum</i>:&mdash; <!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>I believe "post conquestum" was also applied to Edward V.; but the

  <p>I conjecture that the use of the term "post conquestum" thus
  originated.</p>

  <p>As we had Kings of England of the name of Edward before the Conquest,
  Edward the First was distinguished from these monarchs by being styled
  "King Edward, the son of King Henry" (his father was called "King Henry,
  the son of King John"). In like manner, Edward II. was distinguished from
  his father by being called "King Edward, the son of King Edward;" but
  Edward III. could not thus be distinguished from his father; he was
  therefore called King Edward III.; but, as there were Kings Edward
  <i>before</i> the Conquest, the third was qualified by the addition of
  the phrase in question, "post conquestum." To Richard II. generally, and
  to his successors up to Henry VIII. either generally or occasionally, the
  same phrase, "post conquestum," was also applied; but, if we except
  Edward IV. and V., this phrase was not at all required, or applicable in
  their cases, inasmuch as no King of England <i>before</i> the Conquest
  was named either Richard or Henry.</p>

<h3>DESCENT OF HENRY IV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 375.; Vol. iii., p. 120.)</p>

  <p>Upon the deposition of Richard II., 30th September, 1399, Henry IV.,
  then Duke of Lancaster, claimed the crown in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the name of the Fader, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, I, Henry of
  Lancastre, chalenge this Rewme of Ynglonde and the Croune, with all the
  Membres and the appurtenances, als I that am descendit be ryght lyne of
  the Blode comyng fro the gude Lord King Henry thirde, and thorghe that
  ryght that God of his grace hath sent me with helpe of my kyn and of my
  friendes to recover it: the which Rewme was in poynt to be ondone for
  defaut of Governance, and undoying of the gude Lawes."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Rapin observes upon this (vol. i. p. 476.):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was not without reason that he affected to make use of obscure
  expressions, which left undetermined the foundation upon which he built
  his pretended right. If he seemed to derive his title from Henry III.
  rather than from Edward III., his grandfather, it was because there was a
  rumour that Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, surnamed Crouch-back, was eldest
  son of Henry III.; but by reason of his deformity Edward I., his younger
  brother, was placed on the throne. According to this supposition, the
  Duke would have made the ignorant believe he could ground his title upon
  being son of Blanch of Lancaster, granddaughter of Edmund Crouch-back,
  and heiress of that family. But as he was sensible everybody could not be
  imposed upon by so gross a forgery, he added certain expressions,
  intimating that he built his right also upon the service he had just done
  the state. This is the meaning of the claim, expressed in such obscure
  terms. As it was resolved to adjudge the crown to the Duke, the
  Parliament took care not to examine his claim too closely, but were very
  willing to suppose it uncontestable. Thus, without any regard to the just
  rights of the Earl of March, it was decreed that Henry should be
  proclaimed king, which was done that very day," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It would seem, however, that Henry was to a certain extent compelled
  to make his claim to the crown in the form he did (Hales, <i>Hist. C.
  L.</i> c. 5.), notwithstanding his desire to do so as a conqueror. (Seld.
  <i>Tit. Hon.</i> l. 3.)</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Chauncy&mdash;Entwysel.</i>&mdash;To a dry genealogical Query (Vol.
  iii., p. 61.), your readers will wish me to reply as briefly as possible.
  F.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. will find that Sir H. Chauncy's statement is borrowed from
  Weever. The latter founded his statement, that "Wilfred Entwysel was the
  last heir of his house," on the authority of Dalton, Norroy; but this
  statement, as your correspondent has shown, and as other evidence would
  prove, is not well-founded. It may be assumed that Sir Bertyne Entwysel
  did not leave issue, <i>male</i>, by Lucy his wife, the daughter of Sir
  John Ashton, of Ashton-under-Lyne, as Leland speaks of a daughter only,
  "of whom Master Bradene, of Northamptonshire, is descended." His
  connexion with Lancashire is shown by his epitaph, and by our finding his
  name as a witness to a Lancashire charter. The alliance which he formed
  may be urged as a further proof. Leland's expression, that "he came into
  England," may imply that Sir Bertyne remained in France discharging the
  duties of his office, from the period of the Battle of Agincourt, where
  he <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  services were again called for in the Wars of the Roses.</p>

  iii., c. 4., who admits the probability that the Spartans had relation to
  Abraham, as deriving from Phaleg, from whom Abraham came. This appears to
  have been intended by the expressions of Josephus, <span title="ex henos genous kai ek tês pros Abramon oikeiotêtos" class="grk"

  <p>Your correspondent, who, in Vol. ii., p. 230., requests to be supplied
  with "a list of all the theories and publications respecting the ten

  that furnished by Basnage's <i>History of the Jews</i>, in which,
  however, he overlooks the theory of Olaus Rudbeckius, Filius, that they
  are to be found neither in Asia, nor Africa, nor America, but in Lapland!

  exhibit in their true light the singular natural phenomena by which old

  indicate their laws, and to develope their theory"&mdash;and he does this

  <p><i>Directions for the Preservation of English Antiquities, especially
  those of the First Three Periods.</i> By J.&nbsp;Y. Akerman. This little
  tract, which is illustrated with numerous woodcuts, has been prepared by
  the Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries, in a cheap form (it is sold

  circulation, especially among agricultural labourers, it may be the means
  of preserving many remains of interest. Is it too much to ask those who
  approve of Mr. Akerman's object to assist in its circulation; and to
  further that object by depositing any articles which it may be the means
  of rescuing from destruction either in the British Museum, or the Museum
  of the Society of Antiquaries.</p>
